3.What is CDN? Why do we use it?
A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close
to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the 
origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed.

4.Why is React known as React?
React is named React because of its ability to react to changes in data. When the data in a React component changes, React will 
automatically re-render the component so that it reflects the new data. This makes it easy to create performant user interfaces 
that always look up-to-date.

5.What is crossorigin in script tag?
The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.
A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
CORS is used to manage cross-origin requests.

React library is responsible for creating views and ReactDOM library is responsible to actually render UI in the browser.

7.What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
Development mode includes useful warnings and gives you access to tools that make development and debugging easier. 
Production mode minifies your code and better represents the performance your app will have on end users' devices.
